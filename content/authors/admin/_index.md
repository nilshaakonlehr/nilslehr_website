Welcome to my prefessional webpage. I am an economist at the International Monetary Fund specializing in **economic growth**, **innovation**, **entrepreneurship**, and **technology adoption**. My research combines quantitative economic modeling with rigorous empirical methods to illuminate the mechanisms driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and technology choices on a macro scale.
When I am not solving models or analyzing data, I enjoy playing basketball, reading books, and listening to tech and policy podcasts.
Thank you for visiting.
