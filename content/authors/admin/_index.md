Welcome to my personal webpage! I am a macroeconomist focusing on **economic growth**, **innovation**, and **technology adoption**. In my research I combine quantitative economic modeling with rigorous empirical methods to shine light on important mechanisms driving innovation and technology choice on the aggregate.
When I am not solving models or crunching numbers, I enjoy playing basketball, reading non-fiction books, and listening to tech and policy podcasts.
