abstract = {Leading AI firms claim to prioritize social welfare. \emph{How should firms with a social mandate price and deploy AI?} We derive pricing formulas that depart from profit maximization by incorporating incentives to enhance welfare and reduce labor disruptions. Using US data, we evaluate several scenarios. A \emph{welfarist firm} that values both profit and welfare should price closer to marginal cost, as efficiency gains outweigh distributional concerns. A \emph{conservative firm} focused on labor-market stability should price above the profit-maximizing level in the short run, especially when its AI may displace low-income workers. Overall, socially minded firms face a trade-off between expanding access to AI and the resulting loss in profits and labor market risks.},
