abstract = {This paper provides evidence that rising misallocation in the R\&D sector contributed to the recent slowdown in U.S. productivity growth. I develop a growth accounting framework allowing for misallocation of R\&D resources across firms captured by wedges between their marginal cost and benefits of R\&D. I show that R\&D wedges can be measured from R\&D returns and document large and persistent differences in R\&D returns across US-listed firms. Combining data and model, I estimate that frictions reduced productivity growth by 18\% over 1975--2014 and that rising misallocation in the R\&D sector accounts for 25\% of the growth slowdown.},
