abstract = {In this paper, I argue that workforce aging has contributed to the recent productivity slowdown in the US through a technology adoption channel. I document that older workers are slow to adopt new technologies and, motivated
by this evidence, build an endogenous growth model with overlapping generations and costly learning. The model replicates observed cohort patterns in technology adoption and predicts a scale-back of R&D investments in response to an aging workforce together with lower productivity growth in the long run. Interestingly, this might be optimal from a social planner’s perspective. I confirm the model’s predictions for innovation using a local labor markets approach. In particular, I show that commuting zones with an aging workforce invest less in R&D and produce fewer innovations. Evidence and theory thus jointly support the view that workforce aging has contributed to lower productivity growth in the US.},
