abstract: "This paper studies how gradualism affects the welfare gains from trade, technology, and reforms. When people face adjustment frictions, gradual shocks create less adverse distributional effects in the short run. We provide formulas to quantify the distributional gains from gradualism. We also derive formulas for optimal short-run taxes on trade and technology, and show that there are welfare gains from inducing a more gradual transition via temporary distortions. These formulas can be used to compute the optimal timing of economic reforms or trade liberalizations. Using these formulas, we compute the welfare gains from gradualism and the optimal temporary taxes needed to mitigate the distributional consequences of rising import competition from China and the deployment of automation technologies substituting for routine jobs. We also use our formulas to study Colombiaâ€™s trade liberalization in 1990 and show that optimal policy called for a more gradual reform."
