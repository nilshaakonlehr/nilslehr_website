abstract: "This paper documents that average R&D products (ARDPs), defined as the value created from innovation divided by the associated cost, are highly dispersed among US listed, innovation-intensive firms and that this dispersion has increased over time. This finding is surprising ex-ante as workhorse endogenous growth models predict ARDP equalization across firms. After ruling out benign drivers, I argue that ARDP dispersion can be interpreted as misallocation. I develop a growth rate decomposition for a general class of endogenous growth models that allows me to directly link ARDP dispersion to economic growth. Combing data and model I estimate US growth could be up to 30% larger without ARDP dispersion and that its rise can account for up to 50% of the declining long-run growth rate. I investigate potential mechanisms and present reduced form and quantitative evidence in favor of adjustment cost and labor market power."
