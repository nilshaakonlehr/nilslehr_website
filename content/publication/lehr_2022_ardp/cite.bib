abstract = {This paper documents large and persistent differences in R\&D returns across listed US firms, with firms at the 75th percentile having two times the median return. This dispersion is surprising as workhorse endogenous growth models predict that R\&D resources flow from low to high return firms until return equalization. I investigate frictions as a potential mechanism and find mixed results. On the one hand, I document that high R\&D return firms are not credit constrained nor have a higher return on capital, suggesting that financial frictions are not a key driver. On the other hand, I document that high R\&D return firms face a more inelastic supply of inventors, suggesting that return differences might reflect labor-market power. Calibrating a Schumpeterian growth model to match key data moments, I find that inventor market power differences can explain 1/3 of the measured R\&D return dispersion and reduce the annual growth rate by 0.06 p.p., thereby reducing welfare by 2.1\%.},
