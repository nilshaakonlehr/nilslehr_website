abstract = {Need uctuates over the business cycle. We conduct a survey revealing a desire fornonpro t activities to countercyclically expand during downturns. We then demonstrate,using comprehensive US nonpro t data drawn from millions of tax returns,that the public's hopes are disappointed. Nonpro t expenditure, revenue, and balancesheets uctuate procyclically: contracting during national and local downturns. This nding is evident even for a narrow group of nonpro ts the public most wishes wouldexpand during downturns, e.g., those providing critical needs like food or housing. Ournew facts contribute to the charitable giving, nonpro t, and business cycle literatures.},
