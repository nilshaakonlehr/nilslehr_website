abstract = {Need fluctuates over the business cycle, yet little is known about charities over the cycle. This paper exploits data from millions of US nonprofit tax returns and provides key descriptive facts about nonprofits in the face of economic fluctuations. Nonprofit revenue, balance sheets, and spending contract during bad times and grow in good times. Nevertheless, nonprofits partially smooth expenditure relative to income. Non- profits sharply differ from for-profit firms, which exhibit stronger procyclicality and little smoothing. These facts add to the charitable giving literature, documenting outcomes for charities rather than contributors, and the business cycle literature, high- lighting distinct nonprofit versus for-profit cyclicality.},
